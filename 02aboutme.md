<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/IMG_3549.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am currently on a self-study journey to become a full-stack software engineer. What started as a harmless hobby has transformed into a growing interest and passion for software development.</p>

<p>As of now, I am most confident in JavaScript and Python. I have completed various projects using technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Cypress. On the frontend, I have implemented complex state management using technologies like Redux and ReactQuery. Additionally, I have recently ventured into the realm of containers using Docker and currently I'm learning about Kubernetes.</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/B.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I'm very interested in all things code and eager to learn more and get some work experience. I think I've finally found the right career path for me and I'm excited to become a professional coder.</p>

<p>I'm curious by nature and interested in most things, which has led to quite an array of work experience. My employers have described me as diligent, punctual and industrious and I tend to get along with most people. I'm always up for new experiences and adventures and I will work hard and put in the hours to achieve what I set my mind to.</p>

<p> In my spare time I like to move and get active (gym, running, badminton, swimming, snowboarding etc.). I'm also extremely passionate about dog-agility and have been training and competing since I was 11 years old. Other that that I love reading books and travelling</p>
