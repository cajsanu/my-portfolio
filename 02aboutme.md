<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/IMG_3549.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Cajsa, I'm 25 and I currently live in Espoo, Finland. Right now I'm on a self-study journey to become a full-stack software engineer. What started as a harmless hobby has transformed into a growing interest and passion for software development.</p>

<p>As of now, I'm most confident in JavaScript, TypeScript and Python. I have completed various projects using the React ecosystem, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cypress and more. On the frontend, I have implemented complex state management with Redux and for styling I have used Sass, CSS and Tailwind. Additionally, I'm able to skillfully dockerize an application using Docker and docker-compose and currently I'm learning about Kubernetes.</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/B.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I’m currently looking for a position as a junior frontend, backend or full stack software developer and I’m happy to take on any challenge you can throw my way. The more I can learn and develop, the better. I'm very happy, because I think I've finally found the right career path for me and I'm excited to become a professional coder.</p>

<p>I'm curious by nature and interested in most things, which has led to quite an array of work experience. My employers have described me as a diligent, punctual and industrious team player. I'm always up for new experiences and adventures and I will work hard and put in the hours to achieve what I set my mind to.</p>

<p> In my spare time I like to move and get active (gym, running, badminton, swimming, snowboarding etc.). I'm also extremely passionate about dog-agility and have been training and competing since I was 11 years old and other that that I love reading books, travelling and spending time with friends and family.</p>
